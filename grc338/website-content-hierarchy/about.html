            <p>Get Baked, bakery & café was founded in 2007, Jemma from baking 20 hours a day in her home kitchen and selling her delicious creations to Boston farmers’ markets. After only one summer, Get Baked expanded to its first brick-and-mortar bakery in Brookline, Massachusetts. When she opened her very first location she wanted it to feel welcoming, to create a sense of home, a sense of belonging as if someone was hugging you. She has since opened fifteen bakeries but the aim has always remained the same; each has its own individual sense of identity, feel and style but they all stay true to the original spirit – to what Get Baked is all about.
            
            Our mission is to inspire, care for and touch every person, neighborhood and city with our experience and through our food, our passion, and our culture. Tzurit would like to bring Get Baked to as many markets possible, to share that unique experience, the food, the pastries and the atmosphere that Get Baked brings to every location they open.</p>
