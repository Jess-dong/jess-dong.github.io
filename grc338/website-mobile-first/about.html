            <p>Get Baked, bakery & café was founded in 2007, from delicious creations sold to Boston farmers’ markets to expanding to its first brick-and-mortar bakery in Brookline, Massachusetts. We hope that you feel a welcoming, sense of home, a sense of belonging as if someone was hugging you.</p>
            <p>Since the first shop, fifteen more bakeries have been opened, but the aim has always remained the same; each has its own individual sense of identity, feel and style but they all stay true to the original spirit – to what Get Baked is all about. Our mission is to inspire, care for and touch every person, neighborhood and city with our experience, through our food, our passion, and our culture.</p>
